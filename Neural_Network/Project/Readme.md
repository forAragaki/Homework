## Train data
The train data is in https://www.kaggle.com/c/coleridgeinitiative-show-us-the-data/data. And test data will not been published. The result is evaluated by the host.

## Files
The QA_train.ipynb is a notebook, you can run with changing some data path. The QA1_train is training file of  the first QA model and QA2_train is the training file of the second QA model. The \*infer.ipynb is the infer notebook. It need run in kaggle platform because it only can access the test data when you submit the notebook. 

## Results
I tried to get high score and submitted 20 times. But The score can't truly reflect the ability of the model. Because the test data in public test stage is just 10% of all test data. The competition is a bit frustrating because the label is not clearly described and the metric is very sensitive.
